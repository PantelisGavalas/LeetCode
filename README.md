This is the place to put solutions on LeetCode problems. 

The repository is structured in directories based on the language used to solve each of the problems.

In each such directory, the problems are listed starting with their corresponding LeetCode number and then name so they can be easy to find on the website.

The code inside each problem is exactly ready to be submitted on the LeetCode editor space for each problem in order to have a successful submission.
